# LazyAgent Roast - TL;DR

## The Pirate Verdict

| Aspect | Score | Comment |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Problem Clarity | 8/10 | Real pain, well-articulated |
| Spec Quality | 9/10 | Almost suspiciously thorough |
| Actual Code | 1/10 | `print("Hello")` doesn't count |
| Execution Risk | HIGH | Analysis paralysis in full bloom |
| Market Timing | POOR | Tools moving fast, specs don't age well |
| Investment Decision | **PASS** | Come back with users |

## Top 5 Burns

1. **16 spec files, one line of code** - Ye've written a novel about a ship ye haven't built

2. **"Python now, Go later"** - The Titanic also had a great plan for the second voyage

3. **Monetization before product** - Pricing the wine menu for a restaurant that's still a napkin sketch

4. **7 architectural planes** - Even AWS started with one thing that barely worked

5. **Tool adapters as a strategy** - Building on sand that shifts with every Cursor update

## The One Thing To Do

Delete 15 of those 16 spec files. Ship a shell script that creates git worktrees and tracks them. Get 5 real users. Then we'll talk.

## The Silver Lining

- The core problem is real
- The thinking is solid
- The local-first bet is smart
- The name is actually good

Ye just need to stop planning and start shipping.
